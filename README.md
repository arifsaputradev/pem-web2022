- Data Handling: use the form to <b>get data from the user</b>
- <b>Important elements</b> of the form
  - <b>METHOD</b>: Determine how the form input data is sent. To determine how the input data is sent and processed by the PHP method, there are two kinds:
    - <b>GET</b>: Array variable passed to current script via URL parameter
    - <b>POST</b>: Array variable passed to current script via HTTP POST method
  - <b>ACTION</b>: Determines where the input data from the form is processed, if this action is left blank, then the form process occurs on the same page, so the form page and the processing page can be separated or combined.
  - <b>SUBMIT BUTTON</b>: As a trigger for sending data from the input form
- The data on the form can be <b>processed</b>
  - form and process <b>into one</b>
  - <b>separate</b> form and process
- Sending data <b>between</b> web pages
  - <b>stateless http</b> is a connection protocol between the client and server that will be disconnected automatically every time a transaction occurs <b>(request-response)</b>.
  - http is stateless which means that one request is independent of other requests, no state <b>(variable/data)</b> is maintained, thus making one web page unfamiliar with each other's variables/data.
  - the way to <b>overcome</b> stateless http is to:
    - <b>message passing via url/form</b>
    - <b>cookies</b>
      - cookies or http cookies, web cookies, or browser cookies are data or information created by a website to be stored in a web browser, when a user is browsing that website.
      - cookie size is less than 100 bytes, a server can only store approximately 20 cookies in the user's browser, where each cookie is only 4 KB in size.
    - <b>session</b>
      - session allows web pages to store a variable value on the server.
      - session commands:
        - Session_start
        - $\_SESSION["username"]
        - unset($\_SESSION["username"])
        - session_destroy()
